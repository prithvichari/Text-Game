Introduction:

NOTE: This Readme file is best read as a txt file with word wrap mode enabled.

This game was created as a final project for the Object-Oriented Programming class at the Rutgers University New Brunswick campus. It was created by a team of 5 team members who are Prithvi Chari, our group lead, then Obiageli Agbu, Tom Hoshia, Joseph Morath and then George McLaughlin. The purpose of the project was to create a text based adventure game that only uses text input commands, has items, has ways to win or lose the game and must be able to reset back to the beginning. Special thanks to our professor, Akash Pandey.

Without further ado

Welcome to Knights Conquest

Knights Conquest is a text based adventure game on the java platform. The goal of the game is to ultimately win the game by saving the princess through defeating the Malicious Bunny of Malathor. This will be achieved through exploring all the necessary rooms, finding all the items to defeat each enemy. There are several ways to be defeated yourself within this game, this happens through various traps or by having the wrong weapons to defeat your enemies. Each enemy has a specific weakness and therefore you must read carefully what their weaknesses could be. So like any text based adventure game, you must use a bit of logic in order to make your way through the maze and find a way to beat the game. 

Story:

Your story begins in the kingdom of Nalastor. You are a well established knight in your kingdom but with very little experience in battle as there has been peace for many decades. Suddenly and without warning, a dark force has pushed into the kingdom and threatens the peace! The princess of the kingdom is kidnapped by these dark forces that are soon to be discovered to be controlled by the Malicious Bunny of Malathor! This is your call to action! Many knights have been sent before you and have not returned, but this is your chance to prove yourself! The king finally calls for you and gives you this fateful task. Travel to the Lands of Malathor, defeat the Malicious Bunny and his henchmen, and return with the princess!

Characters:

The Knight: You! The knight! You start off with your trusty shortsword and armor. Your objective, to find all the items necessary, defeat the monsters who stand in your way and destroy the Malicious Bunny of Malathor!

The Grand Troll of Enkingdon: This troll has joined forces with the Malicious Bunny to gain power and wealth! He is much taller than Sir Sverre and very nimble and quick, yet doesn't wear any armor, therefore, he might prove to be quite the challenge. He only carries a sword, but is quite capable with it. Perhaps your shortsword might do the trick, but maybe not. Is Sir Sverre capable enough to defeat this troll? Or maybe will he have to get a larger weapon ....

The Beastly Ogre of Matidaconk Swamp: This Ogre is quite beastly, which is why he have been given such a title. Many men have crossed his path, not many have lived. Will Sir Sverre be able to defeat this ogre on his own when many men have fallen before him? Guess you will find out. This Ogre wears very thick armor that has suffered from several cuts, yet has never been penetrated, which is evident since the Ogre is still around. Perhaps another weapon other than your sword is needed ....

The Malicious Bunny of Malathor: This mysterious bunny has learned the ability to use magic! In order to prevent his brethren from becoming delicious rabbit stews he has kidnapped the princess of the Kingdom of Nalastor to intimidate humans! His powerful hind legs allow him to instantly jump from one place to another, and his teeth bite through armor! He is a very malicious bunny indeed, but he does have a certain proclivity towards olives ....

Controls:

The game has many controls that you will need to know in order to complete the game.

Examine: This command will be very important in order to give you an idea of what you should be doing in each room. It will give the description of each room, the items possibly within it and a description of the enemies before you if they are present. You must read carefully.

Move (direction): This command will enable you to navigate and move through the maze. Directions are [Left] [Right] [Forward] [Back] and should look like [Move Forward]

Attack: This is the command you will use, if you chose to, to fight an enemy within the room. It is unwise to charge into battle without using [Examine] first.

Climb: This is the command that will allow you to use the ladder in a room if it is present, it can be used for climbing up and down.

FAQ:

How do I get items? You get items simply by walking into the room, your character will automaticlaly pick them up.

How do I defeat the bunny? Obviously by getting all the items!

Why can't I defeat monster X? You need the right weapon to defeat them! Be sure to [Examine] for clues!


Map: Here is a map to assist you with navigating the rooms in the game if so desired.
